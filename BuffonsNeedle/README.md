Buffon's Needle
------------
This app allows users to enter data for the [Buffon's Needle Experiment](http://mste.illinois.edu/activity/buffon/), in which you can approximate pi by dropping needles onto a surface. The results of the user's drop are uploaded to an [iSENSE project](https://isenseproject.org/projects/2157), while the running total of the pi calculation is stored in a [separate iSENSE project](https://isenseproject.org/projects/2158).
